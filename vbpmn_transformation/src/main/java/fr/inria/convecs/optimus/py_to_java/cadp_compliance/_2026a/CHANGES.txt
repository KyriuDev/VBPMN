The following changes of CADP may have impacted the generated LNT code: #3269, #3270.
Each CADP change is referenced below, with the modifications performed (DONE, UNKNOWN, NOTHING TO DO).
By convention, CADP items are represented with ``----'', while sub-items (such as TRAIAN ones) are
represented with ``####''.

-------------------#3269: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3269
Date:		Mon Jan  5 15:54:38 CET 2026
Author:		Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/evaluator.a, bin.*/evaluator5.a, doc/=READ_ME.txt,
		man/*/evaluator.*, src/eucalyptus/eucalyptus.tcl, ./VERSIONS

Nature:		Following the reorganization of CADP undertaken in October
		2024 (see item #3061 above), the EVALUATOR 3 and EVALUATOR 4
		are now deprecated. EVALUATOR 5 becomes the official version.

		The binaries "bin.*/evaluator3.a" and "bin.*/evaluator4.a"
		are kept in CADP for the moment, but will be eventually
		removed from the distribution.

		The binaries "bin.*/evaluator.a" are no longer symbolic links
		to "bin.*/evaluator4.a", but contain EVALUATOR 5.

		The binaries "bin.*/evaluator5.a" are also deprecated and
		replaced by symbolic links to "bin.*/evaluator.a".

		Preliminary changes have been brought to the EVALUATOR manual
		page.

		The files VERSIONS and doc/=READ_ME.txt have been simplified
		to only mention EVALUATOR instead of EVALUATOR 3, 4, and 5.

		The EUCALYPTUS graphical user interface was simplified. Its
		"Options / EVALUATOR" menu no longer proposes a choice between
		several versions of EVALUATOR. Its "Help / Help Index / Tools
		help" menu only proposes the EVALUATOR man page. Also, its
		"Help / Help Index / Files help" menu only proposes the MCL
		manual page. Finally, its "Help / Tool Versions" menu no
		longer displays the version numbers for EVALUATOR 3 and 4.

-------------------#3270: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3270
Date:		Tue Jan  6 12:00:32 CET 2026
Report:		Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Author:		Frederic Lang (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		src/svl/standard, man/*/svl-lang.*

Nature:		Following the recent changes concerning EVALUATOR (see item
		#3269 above), the SVL language and compiler have been updated
		as follows:

		- The "evaluator" keyword of SVL (which can be used either
		  in a "with" clause or as value for the shell variables
		  $DEFAULT_VERIFY_TOOL" and "$DEFAULT_LOCK_TOOL") now refers
		  to EVALUATOR version 5 rather than version 4.

		- The "evaluator3", "evaluator4", and "evaluator5" keywords
		  of SVL are now deprecated and should be replaced by
		  "evaluator". An SVL warning is issued if they are used.
		  This warning will automatically turn into an error when
		  the binaries bin.*/evaluator3.a, bin.*/evaluator4.a, and
		  bin.*/evaluator5.a will be removed from CADP.

		- As a consequence, the following shell variables are now
		  deprecated:
		     $DEFAULT_EVALUATOR3_LIBRARIES
		     $DEFAULT_EVALUATOR4_LIBRARIES
		     $DEFAULT_EVALUATOR5_LIBRARIES
		     $EVALUATOR3_EXECUTABLE
		     $EVALUATOR4_EXECUTABLE
		     $EVALUATOR5_EXECUTABLE
		     $EVALUATOR3_OPTIONS
		     $EVALUATOR4_OPTIONS
		     $EVALUATOR5_OPTIONS
		  They must be replaced, respectively, by:
		     $DEFAULT_MCL_LIBRARIES
		     $EVALUATOR_EXECUTABLE
		     $EVALUATOR_OPTIONS
