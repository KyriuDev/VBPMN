IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3240

Report:		Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Author:		Frederic Lang (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/traian, doc/pdf/Champelovier-Clerc-Garavel-et-al-10.*

Nature:		Formerly, when LNT expressions and patterns contained mixed
		unary operators (which are prefixed) and "of" clauses (which
		are postfixed), the semantics was ambiguous to human users,
		while the rules followed by LNT2LOTOS and TRAIAN were all
		but intuitive.

		To avoid these issues, the following restrictions have been
		imposed to LNT expressions and patterns. If F is a unary
		operator having a special identifier (e.g., "-", "+", "@",
		etc, but neither "length" nor "ord"), if V is an expression
		or pattern, if T a type, and if E1...En is a list of events:

		a) Any expression or pattern of the form "F V of T" is now
		   forbidden, since it is unclear whether it should be
		   understood as "(F V) of T" or "F (V of T)".

		b) Any expression or pattern of the form "F (V) of T" is now
		   forbidden, since it is unclear whether it should be
		   understood as "(F (V)) of T" or "F ((V) of T)".

		c) Any expression of the form "F [E1...En] V of T" is now
		   forbidden, since it is unclear whether it should be
		   understood as "(F [E1...En] V) of T" or "F [E1...En]
		   (V of T)".

		d) Any expression of the form "F [E1...En] (V) of T" is now
		   forbidden, since it is unclear whether it should be
		   understood as "(F [E1...En] (V)) of T" or "F [E1...En]
		   ((V) of T)".

		In these cases, TRAIAN now emits the following error message:

		   ambiguous mix of unary F and "of" (parentheses needed)

		or, if the expression or pattern contains parentheses around
		V, the following message:

		   ambiguous mix of unary F and "of" (more parentheses needed)

		Note 1: Patterns can not invoke unary operators having
		"[E1...En]" parameters.

		Note 2: If F does not have a special identifier, these
		restrictions do not apply, since there is no ambiguity.
		For instance: "length (L) of Nat" is never understood as
		"length ((L) of Nat)".

		Note 3: There exist a few exceptions to the above rules
		(see item #3241 below).

		TRAIAN and LNT2LOTOS have been updated accordingly. The
		NT2LOTOS Reference Manual was updated to document these
		"ambiguous mix" restrictions and to simplify the table of
		operator precedence (the "of" notation now has the same
		priority as other postfix notations, namely field selection
		".", field update ".{...}", and array access "[...]").

		These changes are not compatible with respect to former
		versions of TRAIAN and LNT2LOTOS. A few LNT programs that
		were formally accepted are now rejected.

		To help the migration, we document here the former behaviour
		of LNT compilers with respect to ambiguous mixes:

		- In LNT expressions: formerly, any expression "F X of T" or
		  "F (X) of T" was understood as "(F (X)) of T". It is now
		  forbidden.

		- In LNT patterns: formerly, any expression "F X of T" was
		  understood as "F (X of T)". It is now forbidden.

		- In LNT patterns: formerly, any expression "F (X) of T" was
		  understood as "(F (X)) of T". It is now forbidden.

-------------------#3241: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3241
Date:		Tue Nov 18 11:47:53 CET 2025
Authors:	Frederic Lang and Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/traian

Nature:		Exceptional rules concerning the mixing of unary operators and
		"of" clauses have been introduced in LNT, as an exception to
		the aforementioned general rules (see item #3240 above). These
		additional rules apply in three particular cases:
		   - expressions of the form "F V of T"
		   - expressions of the form "F [E1...En] V of T"
		   - patterns of the form "F V of T"
		where F is the operator "-" or "+", V is an expression or
		pattern denoting an unsigned numeric constant, and T a type.

		The general rules do not apply in these three cases: the
		three above expressions and patterns are not forbidden and
		are understood as "(F V) of T", "(F [E1...En] V) of T",
		and "(F V) of T", respectively, meaning that the sign is
		considered to be part of the number and has precedence over
		the "of" postfix symbol. For instance, "-1 of Int" and
		"- 1 of Int" are both understood as "(-1) of Int".

		Note 1: Certain expressions or patterns starting with a zero
		("000", "0123", etc.) are not understood as numeric constants,
		but as calls to nullary functions, the name of which is a
		special identifier. The exceptional rules do not apply to
		such expressions or patterns.

		Note 2: The exceptional rules do not apply if V is surrounded
		by parentheses. In such cases, the general rules apply. For
		instance, it is allowed to write either "-1 of Int", or
		"(-1) of Int", or "- (1 of Int)", but writing "- (1) of Int"
		is forbidden. Also, "-128 of Int8" is properly understood as
		"(-128) of Int8", whereas the opposite interpretation
		"- (128 of Int8)" would raise an exception since 128 is not
		a valid 8-bit signed value.

		This change is not compatible with respect to former versions
		of TRAIAN. Concerning expressions, the situation does not
		change, since TRAIAN was already implementing the new
		semantics. Concerning patterns, TRAIAN formerly understood
		"-1 of Int" as "- (1 of Int)", but now understands it as
		"(-1) of Int".

-------------------#3246: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3246
Date:		Wed Nov 26 18:12:00 CET 2025
Authors:	Frederic Lang and Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/traian

Nature:		Similar to the prohibition of ambiguous mixes between unary
		operators and "of" clauses (see items #3240 and #3241 above),
		it is now forbidden to mix unary operators with field selection
		or field updates.

		If F is a unary operator having a special identifier, V an
		expression or pattern, X a field name, and E1...En a list
		of exceptions, the following expressions or patterns are now
		forbidden:
		   a) F V . X
		   b) F V . {...}
		   c) F [E1...En] V . X
		   d) F [E2...En] V . {...}

		In such case, TRAIAN emits the following error message:
		   ambiguous mix of unary F and "." (parentheses needed)

		If V is surrounded by parentheses, the above expressions or
		patterns are also forbidden and, depending on the form of V,
		TRAIAN emits one of the two following error messages:
		   ambiguous mix of unary F and "." (dubious parentheses)
		or
		   ambiguous mix of unary F and "." (more parentheses needed)

		This change is not backward compatible, since LNT programs
		that were formerly accepted are now rejected.

-------------------#3247: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3247
Date:		Thu Nov 27 14:27:07 CET 2025
Authors:	Radu Mateescu and Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		src/mcl/standard.mcl, demos/archive/demo_01.old/demo.svl,
		demos/demo_02/demo.svl, demos/demo_05/demo.svl,
		demos/demo_14/demo.svl, demos/demo_21/demo.svl,

		demos/demo_34/demo.svl, demos/demo_37/demo.svl,
		demos/demo_40/demo.svl

Nature:		The "standard.mcl" library file was enhanced as follows:

		- The macro SOME() was renamed to SOMETIMES(), which is more
		  coherent as SOMETIMES() is the dual of NEVER(). The demos
		  02, 14, 31, and 40 (and the archived demo 01) of CADP have
		  been updated accordingly.

		- The former macro ALWAYS_1_UNTIL_2() was renamed to
		  ONLY_1_INEVITABLE_2(), which is more coherent. Demo 34 was
		  updated accordingly.

		- A new macro POSSIBLE() was defined in "standard.mcl". The
		  demos 02, 05, 14, 21, 22, 37, and 40 were updated to replace
		  many formulas:
		     < true* . A > true
		  and
		     SOMETIMES (true* . A)
		  by
		     POSSIBLE (A)

		- Three new macros named AFTER_1_WITHOUT_2_INEVITABLE_3(),
		  WITHOUT_1_INEVITABLE_2(), and AFTER_1_ONLY_2_INEVITABLE_3()
		  have been defined in "standard.mcl".

-------------------#3248: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3248
Date:		Fri Nov 28 10:52:18 CET 2025
Authors:	Frederic Lang and Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/traian

Nature:		Following prior changes concerning the mixing of unary
		operators and postfix notations (see items #3240, #3241, and
		#3246 above), TRAIAN was further modified with respect to
		mixing of unary operator and array accesses.

		From now on, all expressions of the form "F V1 [V2]", where
		F is a unary operator having a special identifier and where
		V1 and V2 are two expressions, are forbidden in the general
		case. For such ambiguous expressions, which the user should
		rewrite either as "(F V1) [V2]" or "F (V1 [V2])", TRAIAN emits
		the following error message:

		   ambiguous mix of unary F and [...] (parentheses needed)

		Note 1: This only concerns expressions, since patterns cannot
		contain array accesses.

		However, in the particular case where F is the unary operator
		"-" or "+" and V1 a variable, TRAIAN accepts the expression
		"F V1 [V2]" and understands it as "F (V1 [V2])".

		Note 2: the cases where V1 would be a numeric constant are
		not syntactically possible, since the LNT grammar does not
		allow constants to be array names.

		But more complex expressions V1 fall in the general case and
		are thus forbidden. For instance, the following expressions:

		   - (V1 + V2) [V3]
		   - F (V1, V2) [V3]
		   - [E1...En] (V1) [V2]

		are rejected and TRAIAN emits for them the error message:

		 ambiguous mix of unary "-" and [...] (more parentheses needed)

		Similarly, the following expressions:

		   - (V1) [V2]          -- even if V1 is a simple variable
		   - (V1.X) [V2]
		   - (V1 [V2]) [V3]
		   - (F (V1, V2)) [V3]
		   - [E1...En] (V1) [V2]
		   - [E1...En] (V1.X) [V2]

		are rejected and TRAIAN emits for them the error message:

		   ambiguous mix of unary "-" and [...] (dubious parentheses)

		Clearly, these changes are not backward compatible, as TRAIAN
		may now rejects LNT programs that were formerly accepted. In
		general, the user should add extra parentheses to resolve the
		ambiguities reported by TRAIAN. But, in some cases, removing
		parentheses is the solution; for instance, "- (X [I]) [J]"
		may be rewritten to "- X [I] [J]". Such changes bring a gain
		in code readability.

-------------------#3250: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

BUG FIX
Number:		3250
Date:		Mon Dec  1 16:07:27 CET 2025
Author:		Frederic Lang (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/traian

Nature:		TRAIAN was made stricter with respect to modules that use
		types not defined in their parent modules (transitively).
		Formerly, TRAIAN emitted the following message:

		   warning: type T is declared in non-imported module M2

		for each module M1 that uses type T and does not import module
		M2 (for instance, if M2 imports M1, but not the other way
		found). Tolerance towards such irregular uses could cause
		issues in type analysis, possibly leading to spurious errors
		(as types depending on type T could be wrongly considered as
		unproductive or infinite).

		From now on, TRAIAN emits a fatal error (rather than merely a
		warning) whenever a type is declared in a non-imported module.

		As regards those channels, functions, and processes declared
		in non-imported modules, TRAIAN still emits warnings, rather
		than errors (although this may change in the future).

-------------------#3256: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3256
Date:		Fri Dec  5 11:34:00 CET 2025
Report:		Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Author:		Frederic Lang (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/svl_kernel, src/svl/standard, man/*/svl-lang.*

Nature:		The syntax of the SVL operator "|=":

		    [ <diag> = ] <behaviour> "|=" <MCL-or-XTL-formula>;

		was extended to accept also:

		    [ <diag> = ] <behaviour> "|=" <file>

		where diag> is an optional behaviour file that stores a
		diagnostics, <behaviour> is an SVL behaviour, and <file> is
		a file name of either form "<name>.mcl" or "<name>.xtl"
		containing an MCL or XTL formula. The final semicolon (used
		to indicate the end of the inlined formula) is still allowed,
		but no longer mandatory).

		This new syntax is equivalent to the former one:

		    [ <diag> = ] "verify" <file> "in" <behaviour>

		which is now deprecated, since it was less intuitive. The
		SVL language manual page was updated to reflect this change.
		Also, the output displayed by SVL now uses the new syntax
		("|=") rather than the old one ("verify").
