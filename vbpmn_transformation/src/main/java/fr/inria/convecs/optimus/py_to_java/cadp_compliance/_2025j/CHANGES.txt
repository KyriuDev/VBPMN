-------------------#3211: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3211
Date:		Mon Sep 15 15:21:57 CEST 2025
Authors:	Frederic Lang and Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/lnt2lotos, lib/LNT_V1.lib

Nature:		The efforts undertaken to increase the compatibility of
		handwritten ".fnt"/".tnt" files between TRAIAN and LNT2LOTOS
		(see item #3201 above) have been pursued:

		- In the library "LNT_V1.lib", the two LOTOS types REAL and
		  STRING have been equipped with "iteratedby" special comments
		  that strictly match the "!iteratedby" pragmas associated
		  to these types in the LNT library "lnt_predefined.lnt".

		- From now on, for each LNT type T whose corresponding C names
		  are not specified by LNT pragmas (i.e., "!implementedby",
		  "!comparedby", "!iteratedby", or "!printedby"), the LOTOS
		  code generated by LNT2LOTOS to implement type T contains
		  special comments that associate to T the same C names as
		  those generated automatically by TRAIAN for LNT types that
		  lack these pragmas. Precisely, these special comments are:

		  (*! implementedby TRAIAN_TYPE_T comparedby TRAIAN_EQUAL_T
		  iteratedby TRAIAN_ITERATE_FIRST_T and TRAIAN_ITERATE_NEXT_T
		  printedby TRAIAN_PRINT_T *)

		  Formerly, this was done only for LNT types having the pragma
		  "!external". This is now done for all LNT types, ensuring
		  compatible naming conventions between LNT2LOTOS and TRAIAN.
