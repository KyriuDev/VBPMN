The following changes of CADP may have impacted the generated LNT code: #3276; #3277, #3280, #3281.
Each CADP change is referenced below, with the modifications performed (DONE, UNKNOWN, NOTHING TO DO).
By convention, CADP items are represented with ``----'', while sub-items (such as TRAIAN ones) are
represented with ``####''.

-------------------#3276: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3276
Date:		Wed Jan 14 14:33:49 CET 2026
Report:		Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Author:		Frederic Lang (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/svl_kernel, man/*/svl-lang.*,
		demos/demo_15/demo.svl, demos/demo_33/demo.svl

Nature:		Formerly, the SVL language required to enclose shell variables
		between double quotes. For instance, a shell variable $A
		could not be used directly in SVL scripts, but had to be
		written "$A". This was easier for the SVL compiler, but
		slightly annoying for SVL users.

		From now on, SVL no longer requires double quotes around shell
		variables, including when these variables are used in the
		place of transition labels, process names, event parameters,
		or data parameters in process calls.

		Also, the interpretation of double quotes in data parameters
		has changed: formerly, they were ignored; at present, they
		are understood as character-string delimiters.

		These changes are not backward compatible:

		1) A call to process P, passing as data parameter the value
		   of the shell variable A, is now written P [...] ($A)
		   instead of P [...] ("$A").

		2) P [...] ("$A") now denotes a call to process P, passing as
		   data parameter the character string containing the
		   value of the shell variable A; this was formerly written
		   P [...] ("\"$A\"").

		3) P [...] ("\"$A\"") now denotes a call to process P, passing
		   as data parameter the character string containing the value
		   of the shell variable A surrounded by double quotes.

		The outputs generated by SVL have been updated to display
		process calls without double quotes. For instance:
		    "file.lnt":"P [E] (1, false)"
		now displays as:
		    "file.lnt":P [E] (1, false)

		The version number of SVL was advanced to 2.13.

		The CADP demos 15 and 33 of CADP have been modified by
		removing double quotes around shell variables in the data
		parameters of process calls.

-------------------#3277: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3277
Date:		Fri Jan 16 13:56:19 CET 2026
Report:		Hubert Garavel and Wendelin Serwe (INRIA/CONVECS)
Author:		Frederic Lang (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/lnt2lotos, incl/LNT_V1.h, lib/LNT_V1.lib

Nature:		LNT2LOTOS was enhanced in several ways to support the recently
		introduced !implementedby "C:..." pragmas (see item #3275
		above):

		1) LNT2LOTOS now supports these pragmas and generates LOTOS
		   code in which the "%s" strings are replaced by field names.

		2) The LOTOS operations and C functions generated by LNT2LOTOS
		   from the "with get" and "with set" clauses were modified
		   to be compatible with the C code generated by TRAIAN.
		   Formerly, these operations and functions used 3 parameters
		   to encode exceptions (exception name, file name, line
		   number). From now on, these three parameters are merged
		   into a single one: the LOTOS type EXCEPTION__EXIT (defined
		   in "LNT_V1.lib" and implemented in "LNT_V1.h") now has
		   two extra fields (file name and line number). These changes
		   increase the compatibility of user-written ".tnt" and
		   ".fnt" files across TRAIAN and LNT2LOTOS.

-------------------#3280: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3280
Date:		Mon Jan 26 10:10:29 CET 2026
Report:		Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Author:		Frederic Lang (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/svl_kernel, com/upc, src/svl/standard, man/*/svl-lang.*,
		demos/demo_08/demo.svl, demos/demo_08/LOTOS/demo.svl,
		demos/demo_10/demo.svl, demos/demo_31/demo.svl,
		demos/demo_31/LOTOS/demo.svl, demos/demo_33/demo.svl

Nature:		The SVL language was modified in order to prepare its future
		evolution (see item #3293 below). The ":" symbol (used to
		specify the main process of a LOTOS or LNT program) is now
		noted "at", e.g.:
		   "bitalt.lnt":TRANSMITTER [PUT, SDT, SACK, SACKE] (0)
		is now noted:
		   "bitalt.lnt" at TRANSMITTER [PUT, SDT, SACK, SACKE] (0)

		The outputs generated by the SVL compiler have been modified
		to use "at" rather than ":".

		The ":" symbol is now deprecated. It is still accepted, but
		a warning is emitted.

		Users are advised to update their ".svl" files. This can be
		done automatically by typing the following command:
		   upc 2026-SVL-COLON <directory>
		which will recursively explore the contents of the specified
		<directory> and perform appropriate substitutions in ".svl"
		files automatically.

-------------------#3281: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3281
Date:		Wed Jan 28 16:37:29 CET 2026
Report:		Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Author:		Frederic Lang (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/svl_kernel, src/svl/standard, man/*/svl-lang.*

Nature:		The execution of SVL was modified: when an SVL verification
		statement is followed by a "result" keyword, the TRUE/FALSE
		verdict of this statement is no longer displayed by SVL on
		standard output. From now on, it is the responsibility of the
		user to display or not this verdict, depending on the needs.
		Notice that the TRUE/FALSE verdict is still written in the
		SVL log file, without any change.
